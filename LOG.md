  The MPL model does not manage to generalize, the gap between training and validation loss remains very high, whatever regularization, dropout or simple model I use.
  This could be due to a lack of data in the past to forecast the future.

![Monthly French prices](docs/monthly_FR_price.png)

  Indeed the val set was composed of prices from 2021 to 2023 which were much higher than usual. So I removed month with 3-months-rolling average above 100 â‚¬/MWh. And now the model generalizes much better.

Final Training Metrics:
RMSE: 11.5553
['mae']: [6.47]

Final Validation Metrics:
RMSE: 19.0647
['mae']: [13.6979]


  Fuel prices were not included, they were removed in the method create_features. Results largely improved when they are included, see below.

  Added crossborder flows from ENTSO-E

  The next dataset should contrain crossborder flows.
